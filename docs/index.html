          Players alternate turns, moving their pawns along the lines into vacant 
          intersections on the board in an effort to capture enemy pawns. Capturing pawns 
          is done via the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Custodian_capture#:~:text=Custodial%20capture%20is%20a%20technical%20term%20in%20board,during%20the%20Dark%20Ages%2C%20particularly%20in%20Northern%20Europe.">custodian method</a>, 
          whereby a player positions two of their pawns on opposite sides of an opponent's pawn. 
          Captures can only be performed during the 
          turn of the player making the capture. Captured pieces are removed from the board 
          at the end of a playerâ€™s turn. The game is won when your opponent is reduced 
          to a single pawn, or is no longer able to move any of their pawns.
